InterviewIQ 🚀

Prepare Smarter. Perform Better.

InterviewIQ is a full-stack MERN SaaS application that helps users prepare for interviews using AI-powered features. Users can upload resumes, generate interview questions, practice technical & HR rounds, and receive intelligent feedback — all powered by a scalable credit-based system.
This project focuses on real-world SaaS architecture, payments integration, authentication, and production deployment rather than basic CRUD functionality.

🔐 Authentication Flow
Users sign in securely using Firebase Google Authentication.
